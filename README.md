# Qwik City TODO App ⚡️

Todo App developed to learn about the `QWIK` framework.

The App is connected to `Supabase`.

## Environment

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your supabase url>
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your supabase public key>
```

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). During development, the `dev` command will server-side render (SSR) the output.

```shell
npm start # or `yarn start`
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite may request a significant number of `.js` files. This does not represent a Qwik production build.

## Preview

The preview command will create a production build of the client modules, a production build of `src/entry.preview.tsx`, and run a local server. The preview server is only for convenience to locally preview a production build, and it should not be used as a production server.

```shell
pnpm preview # or `yarn preview`
```

## Production

The production build will generate client and server modules by running both client and server build commands. Additionally, the build command will use Typescript to run a type check on the source code.

```shell
pnpm build # or `yarn build`
```
